# CS3220GroupA
Repo for the second assignment for CS3220

The goal is to make generative, addaptive music (as seen in video games) with the use of the visual programing language Pure Data (pD).

There are to be 2 different themes:

1. Generic overworld.
2. Battle music.

The transition between these two types will be aided by the use of a masking track (like Final Fantasy), however the prefered method would be to use real-time sound morphing. Another way would be through changing speeds of the two patterns in a user defined ammount of time so that the two tracks match.

The most difficult issues to solve would be the transition from one track to another due to timing issues. The quality of the sound is of concern as well (no clicks and blips).

The GUI needs to be uncomplicated to use and easy to uderstand.
